										<h3>Everything You Need To Know About Kalamkari Prints</h3>
										<p>Kalamkari literally translates into ‚Äúpen craft‚Äù; with ‚Äòkalam‚Äô meaning pen and ‚Äòkari‚Äô meaning art. It is among the most beautiful traditional Indian art forms and involves block printing or hand printing, typically done on pieces of cotton fabrics. The unique feature of the Kalamkari art is that it makes use of only natural colours or vegetable dyes.</p>

										<p>Kalamkari art and printing is concentrated primarily in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in Kalahasti and Machilipatnam, and a few other smaller regions of the state. Srikalahasti was the main center of kalamkari art for a very important reason: it received a constant supply of clean river water. Kalamkari art was the household occupation of several rural women and craftsmen in the ancient times and continues to be passed down from one generation to the next. Andhra Pradesh is still the main hub of kalamkari printing in the country. </p>

                                        <p>Craftsmen engaged in kalamkari art had to later modernize some of the ancient, hindu-mythology inspired kalamkari themes because there was an increasing demand for these prints in the international market. Therefore, Persian art slowly became one of the major influences on the original kalamkari designs.</p>

									<h3> Dabu Printing - An Ancient Art Of Rajasthan </h3>
									<p>Dark earthy tones in a medley of breathtaking prints -  'Daboo' or ‚ÄòDabu‚Äô (Mud Resist Printing), as it is more commonly known, is an ancient Rajasthani printing technique that involves scrupulous attention to detail across the many stages of making it. Let's find out more! </p>

									<p>Dabu print motifs are believed to have originated from China, and the technique dates back to 675 AD. It then travelled to Rajasthan, which became the highest producer of block printed fabrics. Akola Village, Rajasthan is where Dabu print started blooming. Initially, Rajasthan had a large number of artisans engaged in Dabu printing, but only a few remain today to take this age-old legacy forward.</p>

                                    <p>Dabu print is hand blocked on various silhouettes like sarees, suits and kurtas. Not limited to just apparel, Dabu is a popular category in home decor items too. This print is designed on fabrics like silk, georgette and crepe as they hold colours quite well, however, cotton remains the most widely used fabric for Dabu printing.</p>

										<h3> Block-Making: Decoding The Art </h3>
									<p>A manifestation of the design sketch into reality, the process of block-making marks the beginning of the production process of a typical FG style. Laborious yet rewarding, it involves many stages.</p>

                                        <p>Tracing of the design (likhai) with calligraphic charm, the first stage involves recreating the sketch on a wooden block. Creating depth and dimension, each block is then carefully carved to capture the finest of details. The main block that represents the outline of a printed pattern is referred to as the Main Block or the ‚Äòrekh‚Äô. The smaller blocks that fill out colour in the motifs are individually known as ‚Äòdatta‚Äô, while the intricate jaal prints require a different kind of block called ‚Äònas‚Äô.</p>

										<p>Employing an artillery of tools, the artisans sculpt these elaborate motifs into existence. Chiseled to perfection, a millimeter‚Äôs worth of distance can be depicted in the patterns orchestrated within the crevices of these blocks. Rough around the edges, yet refined in its intricacies, the art of block-making is truly remarkable.A little known fact about hand block-printed styles is that as per common practice, even a single buti motif usually requires multiple blocks to be recreated on fabric.</p>
